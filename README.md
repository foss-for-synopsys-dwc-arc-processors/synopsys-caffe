# Synopsys Caffe

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/foss-for-synopsys-dwc-arc-processors/synopsys-caffe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/foss-for-synopsys-dwc-arc-processors/synopsys-caffe)

Synopsys Caffe is a modified version of the popular [Caffe Deep Learning framework](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) adapted for use with DesignWare EV6x Processors.
It combines multiple customized branches and includes a large range of patches to support diverse models. See [FEATURES.md](https://github.com/foss-for-synopsys-dwc-arc-processors/synopsys-caffe/blob/master/FEATURES.md) for a short overview.

## Installation
Please check out the prerequisites and read the detailed notes at the [BVLC Caffe Installation](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html) if this is your first time to install Caffe.

### Linux
A simple guide:
1. Ensure that you have all the dependencies mentioned at the [BVLC Caffe Installation](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html) for your OS installed (protobuf, leveldb, snappy, opencv, hdf5-serial, protobuf-compiler, BLAS, Python, CUDA etc.)
2. Also Install [matio](https://github.com/tbeu/matio) in your environment. After that, add [your installed matio path]/lib to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
```Shell
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=[your installed matio path]/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
```
3. Checkout the Synopsys Caffe **master** branch. Configure the build by copying and modifying the example Makefile.config for your setup.
```Shell
git clone https://github.com/foss-for-synopsys-dwc-arc-processors/synopsys-caffe.git
cd synopsys-caffe
cp Makefile.config.example Makefile.config
# Modify Makefile.config to suit your needs, e.g. enable/disable the CPU-ONLY, CUDNN, NCCL and set the path for CUDA, Python and BLAS.
# If needed, add [your installed matio path]/include to INCLUDE_DIRS and [your installed matio path]/lib to LIBRARY_DIRS.
```
4. Build Caffe and run the tests.
```Shell
make all
make pycaffe
make test
make runtest
# If no error occurs, you can add the caffe path to the environment for easy use.
export SYNOPSYS_CAFFE_HOME=[your synopsys-caffe root folder path]
export PATH=${SYNOPSYS_CAFFE_HOME}/build/tools:${PATH}
export PYTHONPATH=${SYNOPSYS_CAFFE_HOME}/python:${PYTHONPATH}
```

### Windows
A simple guide:
1. Download the **Visual Studio 2015 Update 3** (Do not use the VS 2017, it is not supported!). Choose to install the support for visual C++ instead of applying the default settings.
2. Install the CMake 3.4 or higher. Install Python 2.7 or 3.5. Add cmake.exe and python.exe to your PATH.
3. After installing the Python, please open a `cmd` prompt and use `pip install numpy` to install the **numpy** package.
4. Checkout the Synopsys Caffe **master** branch for build. The windows branch is deprecated, please do not use it. We use `C:\Projects` as the current folder for the following instructions.
```cmd
C:\Projects> git clone https://github.com/foss-for-synopsys-dwc-arc-processors/synopsys-caffe.git
C:\Projects> cd synopsys-caffe
:: Edit any of the options inside build_win.cmd to suit your needs
C:\Projects\synopsys-caffe> scripts\build_win.cmd
:: If no error occurs, the caffe.exe will be created at C:\Projects\synopsys-caffe\build\tools\Release after a successful build.
```
Other detailed installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/windows/README.md).
